PnWKit is here to make interacting with the V3 Politics and War API easy. // TODO

# Testing

### Setup

Tests won't work right away, you have to specify private information inside the test/testconfig.json file.

It should look like this:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "xxxxx"
}
```

After that just run ```npm run test```
